Mission Marcus ReadME File

Things to Note:

1. The program will quit if q, quit, or exit are typed at any time. 
2. The drop, get, use, or go commands will not do anything and return an invalid command, unless an item or direction is specified. 
3. The makefile will make the program, all you need to do is type java GameTester to run the game. I've already provided the files in the same directory, so all you need to do is add them to the directory so my program can find them.
